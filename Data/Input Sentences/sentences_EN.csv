4,Blinken said it was in the US' own interests to ensure Ukraine could ward off the Russian assault.
5,"""If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is allowed to proceed with impunity, we know he won't stop at Ukraine,"" Blinken said."
6,"Kuleba said the US aid package, which has long been blocked by Republicans in Congress, ""will literally, without exaggeration, help save Ukrainians from Russian missile slaughter."""

17,"The researchers gathered the data by questioning some 2,000 representatives of academia, business, government and civil society in January and February this year."
18,The results show that there is now less trust in the EU to uphold free trade or the rules-based order compared with last year.
19,"Less than 14% of the respondents see the EU as the leading champion of the global free trade agenda, down from almost 22% in last year's survey."
20,"The survey also showed there is now less confidence that the EU would ""do the right thing"" to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity and governance."
21,"Of those who had little or no trust in the EU to ""do the right thing,"" almost a third said it was because they thought Brussels was ""distracted with its internal affairs and thus cannot focus on global concerns and issues."""
22,"""The findings of the State of Southeast Asia 2024 survey underline that the European Union needs to increase its cooperation efforts with Southeast Asia substantially,"" said David McAllister, chair of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee."
23,"Indeed, the same State of Southeast Asia survey found that Southeast Asians ranked the Gaza conflict as the most important geopolitical issue, beating the region's own concerns, such as tensions in the South China Sea and a civil war raging in Myanmar."
24,"Even before the war in Gaza escalated, the EU had been locked in a spat with Malaysia and Indonesia, the world's two largest palm oil producers, over Brussels' deforestation legislation."
25,The EU plans to ban the import of goods that can be traced to deforestation.
26,Several Southeast Asian states say this unfairly impacts their agricultural sectors and doesn't recognize the climate efforts they are making.

29,"""While this year the EU's position overall has weakened slightly, the overall assessment of the EU's role remains strong and positive,"" Stano said."
30,"Stano also advised caution over reading too much into the survey, noting that the composition of its respondents by geographic location and sector changes every year."
31,"""It's surprising how the EU's contributions and active engagement with the region are not properly reflected in the survey,"" he said, adding that perhaps the pollsters ""could have framed the questionnaire more carefully."""
32,"For the most part, the survey results indicate that there is still hard work left to do for the EU to convince Southeast Asians of its long-term interests in the region."
33,"""It is all about rolling up our sleeves, sitting down with our friends in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, and crafting deals that are fair, that help everyone grow and feel secure in their future,"" he told DW."

40,Providing security for the opening ceremony alone will be a huge logistical challenge: 160 boats carrying athletes are due to sail six kilometers (3.78 miles) along the Seine River.
41,But he has also admitted that there are back-up plans in place should the security threat become too acute.
42,Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine and concerns about a further escalation of the situation in the Middle East have exacerbated fears of a security threat.

45,The German Football League (DFL) has suspended its bidding process for the sale of the Bundesliga's domestic broadcast rights following a complaint from a bidder of unfair treatment.
46,It's been an historic week for German football on the pitch as Bayer Leverkusen won the Bundesliga for the first time and both Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich progressed to the semifinals of the Champions League.
47,"But it's also a big week off the pitch as the German Football League (DFL), which operates the Bundesliga, opens the bidding for the sale of its domestic broadcast rights for the seasons 2025/26 to 2028/29."
48,The billion-euro negotiations take place every four years and are a vital process since they concern German football clubs' most important revenue stream.
49,"However, the DFL confirmed on Wednesday evening that it had taken the unprecedented step of suspending the auction after just three days following a legal complaint from one of the bidders, current rights holder DAZN."
50,"According to German media reports, the online streaming service has complained of unfair treatment by the DFL, accusing the league of ""abusing its dominant position in the football broadcast rights market"" and ""contravening German and European competition law."""
51,We are led to believe that our financial offer lay substantially above every other offer.
52,"Rights package B is the largest package on sale, according the winning bidder the rights to exclusively broadcast 196 live games per season, including the five 3:30 p.m. kickoffs every Saturday, the weekly Friday night fixtures and the end-of-season relegation/promotion play-offs."
53,"DAZN, which in the current broadcast deal has the rights to the Friday and Sunday fixtures, making it the DFL's second-biggest broadcast partner, says it had bid for the package against pay TV broadcaster Sky, the premier partner which currently holds the rights to all Saturday matches."
54,The DFL confirmed the reports to the German SID sports news agency on Wednesday night but strongly rejected the accusations.
55,"""The insinuations and accusations raised are incorrect and unfounded and we reject them in the strongest possible terms,"" it said in a statement, claiming that the DAZN letter of complaint contains ""numerous incorrect portrayals and misrepresentation of facts."""
56,"It insisted that it is conducting the auction process in adherence to all relevant rules and regulations and ""in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner,"" but that chief executives Marc Lenz and Steffen Merkel had decided to temporarily halt the auction ""in order to protect the legal security of the process."""
57,"The legal dispute comes at a highly inopportune time for the DFL, whose current domestic broadcast deals with Sky and DAZN run out at the end of this season in June."
58,"The current deals are worth around 1.1 billion ($1.17 billion), a sum which is divided up among Bundesliga clubs according to a points-based formula."
59,But it now faces the prospect of weeks or months of potential legal wrangling.
60,Researchers in Germany estimate that climate change will shrink global GDP at least 20% by 2050.
61,A study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) published in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday claimed that climate change is poised to wipe out some 20% of global GDP by 2050.
62,Researchers at PIK said their calculations were based on the prospect of countries such as Germany achieving their emissions-cutting goals.
63,"Currently, most countries look unlikely to achieve these targets, meaning the financial impact could be greater still than the drastic damage projected."
64,"According to the study's calculations, the economic burden of climate change could reach $38 trillion (35.6 trillion) annually, a sum six times higher than the estimated cost of limiting global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels."
65,"The study points out that despite damage affecting different regions to different degrees, poorer regions and those contributing least to global warming will be hit hardest."
66,"""Countries least responsible for climate change are predicted to suffer income loss that is 60% greater than the higher-income countries and 40% greater than higher-emission countries,"" said Anders Levermann, a senior PIK scientist."
67,"These losses are caused by a wide range of economically relevant effects of climate change, such as consequences for agricultural yields, labor productivity and infrastructure."
68,"Others pointed out that the new study appears to confirm conclusions similar to those in the so-called Stern Report, which was produced by economist Nicholas Stern in 2006 at the behest of the UK government."
69,Observers say the PIK estimate is likely an undercount of the actual economic impact.
70,"""In addition, we must drastically and immediately reduce our CO2 emissions  otherwise the economic losses will be even higher in the second half of the century and will amount to a global average of up to 60% by the end of the century,"" she said."
71,The German-Russian nationals are accused of acting as agents for sabotage purposes.
72,German police arrest two suspected of spying for Russia
73,Germany also summoned Russia's ambassador in Berlin after the arrests were announced.
74,"""We will not allow Putin to bring his terror to Germany,"" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter."
75,"The men were said to have scouted out potential attack targets, including US military bases in Germany."
76,The accused is said to have been exchanging ideas with the agent since October 2023 about possible sabotage action.
77,"The actions were intended, in particular, to undermine the military support provided by Germany and its allies to Ukraine."
78,"He had scouted out some of the targeted objects, taking photos and videos of, for example, military transports and goods."
79,He is then said to have passed the collected information to his handler.
80,"Authorities say Germany, which has become one of Kyiv's biggest suppliers of military aid, is a key target for Russian spying operations."
81,"""Our security authorities have prevented possible explosive attacks that were intended to target and undermine our military assistance to Ukraine,"" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in response to the arrests."
82,We will continue to provide Ukraine with massive support and will not allow ourselves to be intimidated
83,"""The information itself is not a big deal but, at the same time, what is already reported is that people were involved also in the preparation of some sabotage activities on the territory of Germany,"" he said."
84,It means that actually Russians have a huge network of people who live in Germany and have even legal grounds to live there  have citizenship and who can be used for any kind of activities.
85,Danylyuk said it was particularly disturbing that at least one of the two suspects had participated in Russian aggression against Ukraine before in Donetsk.
86,The 4 simple tests you can do at home that reveal how fit you are for your age.
87,Can you stand up from the floor without the aid of your hands or hold a plank for more than 20 seconds?
88,How many push-ups you can do or how long you can hold a plank will earn you more than just bragging rights at the gym.
89,"According to fitness experts, they're markers of how well you're ageing."
90,Equinox share a guide on how many push-ups you should be able to manage according to your age and gender
91,It's natural for your endurance and muscle strength to lessen as you get older.
92,"Your balance, strength and cardiorespiratory fitness can start to decline as early as our thirties, the Washington Post reports."
93,"But having an idea of your so-called ""fitness age"" could allow to address declines in your health by making relatively simple tweaks, experts argue."
94,"For example, making changes to benefit your cardiovascular health have been shown to add years to your life."
95,"Dr Randall Espinoza, associate director at the UCLA Longevity Center, told Washington Post that after you've got an idea of your fitness benchmarks, you should aim to keep them in an optimal range to help manage your ageing."
96,"Michael Crandall, a certified strength and conditioning specialist at E by Equinox gym in New York, proposed trying four fitness tests that take into account strength, power, muscular endurance and balance."
97,"According to Michael, you can perform these at home with little to no equipment."
98,"Some fitness-gauging tests are pass-fail, while others provide more specific test scores to compared with those of people who are the same age and gender as you."
99,"An important term when it comes to ""fitness age"" is your VO2 max, a measure of your maximum aerobic capacity, which experts say is key measure of longevity."
100,"The American Heart Association has argued that it should be considered a vital sign thats regularly measured by doctors, just like your blood pressure."
101,Research suggests your VO2 max will decline by roughly 10 per cent each decade of early adulthood and up to 15 per cent every 10 years after the age of 50.
102,"But by doing the right kind of cardio exercise throughout your life, one case study suggests that its possible to have the VO2 max of a 35-year-old when youre 80."
103,"Tests to gauge your VO2 max will usually involve you walking or running on treadmill until you can't continue, hooked up to mask and under the supervision of a health professional."
104,"To test your aerobic fitness yourself at home, try seeing how far you can run in 12 minutes -  then use this conversion to calculate your VO2 max and fitness ranking based on your age and gender."
105,"But this test - developed by Dr Kenneth Cooper, founder of the Cooper Institute in Dallas - shouldn't be attempted by anyone who isn't healthy or active already."
106,The next test aims to get an idea of your upper body strength and it's the dreaded push-up.
107,"Start in a plank, with hands your just outside of your shoulders and lower your body by bending your arms until they are bent past 90 degrees."
108,"This exercise measures how well you can move your body weight, according to Michael."
109,"If you can't lower yourself far enough, place a yoga block under your chest to help you."
110,"To test your cores muscular endurance, do a side plank with your feet stacked, knees locked and one elbow on the ground."
111,"If you can hold it with good form for more than 45 seconds, then youre above average!"
112,"Between 20 to 45 seconds is good, but if you crumple on the floor before that, it's a good indication that you need to work on your core strength regardless of your gender or age."
113,"Most of us will use the support of our hands to shift ourselves off the floor, but have you ever tried to without?"
114,This is tougher the older you get because it is a test of mobility and strength in lots of small muscles that contribute to balance.
115,Google reveals major YouTube crackdown that will block you from avoiding ads with trick  the alternative is costly
116,The search engine giant will now block you from watching videos if you break the rule.
117,These apps are designed to let you watch YouTube videos without having to endure ads.
118,"But Google says this can't continue, and will now prevent users from watching videos if they're taking advantage of these apps."
119,"""Were strengthening our enforcement on third-party apps that violate YouTubes Terms of Service, specifically ad-blocking apps,"" a YouTube spokesperson explained."
120,"We want to emphasize that our terms dont allow third-party apps to turn off ads because that prevents the creator from being rewarded for viewership, and Ads on YouTube help support creators and let billions of people around the world use the streaming service."
121,"Like with regular TV, YouTube serves up ads to generate money that funds the service."
122,And it also pays some of these ad earnings to creators who fill the app with content.
123,"If you really hate ads, there is an official option you can take advantage of."
124,Its main perk is that you can enjoy an entirely ad-free version of YouTube where your videos won't be interrupted.
125,"But it has some bonus features too, including the ability to download videos for offline viewing."
126,Google will be hoping that many users who can no longer block ads will turn to paying for YouTube Premium instead.
127,Google users have been warned to never ignore an important Gmail notification that could signal a scam.
128,"In the hopes of combating scams and malware, Google administers warnings whenever someone receives a suspicious-looking email."
129,These dangerous files can attack your device using different methods and typically hope to steal sensitive information.
130,They can also monitor and record your device's activity without your knowledge.
131,"Malware detection is turned on by default on Google Chrome, and because of this, users may receive messages alerting them to dangerous emails."
132,"""If the email has suspicious links or asks you to do unusual things like send money or personal information, the message may be a scam sent without permission from your contact's email account,"" Google notes on its webpage."
133,"You can also report the email to Google by clicking ""Report this suspicious message."""
134,"The message will be marked as ""sent from a compromised account,"" and will notify the Gmail team."
135,"Lastly, if the suspicious email came from a trustworthy person, inform them about the message (but not over email)."
136,Becky (whose name has been changed) is one of many who lost hundreds of pounds to a Booking.com scam while on a trip to Thailand in October 2023.
137,"She had booked a hotel for one night in Bangkok, to stay in before heading to the airport for her flight home the next day,"
138,"However, before arriving at the hotel, she received a message on the Booking.com platform asking for payment in the local currency."
139,"But she told: ""I should have picked up that this was more than I paid for the hotel, but it was obviously in a different currency, and when you are panicking, your booking may be cancelled whilst, on the route in the middle of the night, it's not your first thought."
140,"A week before departure, Viktoria got a message, apparently from the hotel, saying she must pay £791 towards her stay or the reservation would be cancelled."
141,"She said: Because the message appeared in my Booking.com account and looked so official, I felt like I had to follow orders."
142,It wasnt until Viktoria and her mum got to the hotel that she realised she had been scammed as the receptionist told her the full £937 for their 11-night break still had to be paid.
143,"Viktoria fought for five months to get her money back, but Booking.com, the hotel and her bank all refused."
144,"Commenting on these scams, Booking.com reiterated that its own security had not been breached but confirmed that con artists had compromised the IT systems of a number of the venues it lists."
145,"This can happen if a member of the hotel's staff mistakenly clicks on a link in an email sent by criminals, who can then log into the hotels account on the booking site and message customers directly."
146,"Anyone who receives a message on the Booking.com platform that asks you to make a payment should call their hotel, airline or other service provider to check that they're genuine."
147,"There is no guarantee you'll get your money back, but banks will often compensate you if you can show you did not know the money would leave your account."

151,The 44-year-old then collided with the corner of a parked car before crossing a lay-by and slamming into the back of a tanker.
152,"Riding admitted causing Alice's death by dangerous driver but avoided a jail term - despite colleagues describing his driving as ""very fast"" and accusing him of ""showing off""."
153,"He was instead handed a prison sentence of nine months, suspended for 18 months."
154,Alice was eventually rescued from the ambulance but had suffered life-threatening injuries and couldn't be saved.
155,A cause of death was given as lower limb and pelvic fractures with retroperitoneal haemorrhage from a vehicular crash.
156,"I felt unsafe with him, I was scared of Zeke's driving, and I felt that I had no option but to raise this with a supervisor."
157,"Another student paramedic, Megan Kuhn, was in the back of the vehicle and suffered a severe concussion, a bleed on the brain and bruising down her left side."
158,"The driver of the Volvo tanker was left with a split to his left eyebrow, a swollen eye, cuts and bruises and a torn ligament in his neck."
159,"Riding was airlifted to hospital with rib fractures, a dislocated hip and several leg fractures."
160,"As well as a suspended prison sentence, Riding was banned from driving for 15 months and ordered to pay £826 in court costs."
161,"The nationwide doctors' strike in Kenya began on March 12, with at least 4,000 medics demanding higher salaries as part of a 2017 collective bargaining agreement, better working conditions and the employment of intern doctors."
162,The government rejected the doctors' demands and made a counteroffer which was rejected by the doctors' union.
163,"With medical professionals absent from their posts, hospitals, and clinics, many patients were left unattended and desperate for medical assistance."
164,"According to local media reports, a young man died from what first appeared to be a toothache but then advanced to a blood infection and malaria."
165,A Kenyan court has given the government and the medical union 48 hours to agree on a deal.
